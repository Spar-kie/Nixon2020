        <h2>THE MISSION</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Spar-kie, campaign manager of Nixon 2020, and soon to be vice president under the Nixon administration. My goal is to get Richard Nixon re-elected for President of The United States.</p>
        <h2>WASN'T HE LIKE, IMPEACHED?</h2>
        <p>He quit before he could be impeached, and was then pardoned by Gerald Ford, so Nixon's hands are completley clean!</p>
        <h2>CAN'T A PRESIDENT ONLY BE IN OFFICE TWICE?</h2>
        <p>I mean yea, but I'm sure if we ask really nicely the supreme court would make an exception.</p>
        <h2>NIXON WAS A REPUBLICAN, AND THE CURRENT INCUMBENT PRESIDENT IS ONE, WOULDN'T THIS SPLIT THE PARTY?</h2>
        <p>Shut up with your logic, Nixon died in the 90s and the thing you're worried about is 'splitting the party'? That is hardly the biggest flaw in this plan.</p>
        <h2>AREN'T YOU A BIT YOUNG TO BE A VICE-PRESIDENT?</h2>
        <p>Yes, yes I am.</p>
